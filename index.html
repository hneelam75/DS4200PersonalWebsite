        Hi! I'm Havisha, and I'm currently a third year at Northeastern majoring in Data Science and Biology combined. I was
        originally a Computer Science and Biology major, but switched after being introduced to Python and SQL. Since software
        engineering or game development weren't quite my cup of tea, I found data analytics and visualization extremely interesting,
        as I could see the ways in which it could be applied to other fields (mainly the life sciences). Considering that programming
        experience would be a plus to have as a science major, I strongly think that switching my major was the right decision. With
        future ambitions of working in bioinformatics, neuroinformatics, or genetics/cancer research, I think that a solid understanding
        of Python, R, MatLab, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JS would be crucial for developing visualizations, websites, and programs to identify
        target gene markers and/or sequences. As I prepare to apply for co-ops next semester, I am eager to potentially be able to work
        at a well-known pharmaceutical company in the Boston area, or at a hospital lab in the Longwood medical area. More broadly, however,
        my interest in the life sciences stemmed from my previous STEM classes and the "Women in STEM" club that I founded in high school.
        With more knowledge and a new network of women to connect with, I was able to understand the pivotal contributions made by underrated
        women in STEM, and appreciate the work that has been done over the decades for breaking barriers and normalizing merit/talent over
        gender/ethnicity. Additionally, taking Neurobiology this semester has also allowed me to see how the brain functions at a biological
        level and further cultivate my interests in neuroscience. I hope that this class will allow me to work towards my academic and
        professional goals, in addition to better understanding Python and other libraries!
