    <h2>A Deep Dive into My Interests</h2>

        Hi again, and welcome to another corner of my personal website! This is a chance for me to
        go into more depth about my hobbies and interests (outside of university). From a very young
        age of four, I have been learning vocal classical Indian (a.k.a. Carnatic) music, which has
        been an integral part of how I view my culture and my identity as an Indian person. Music has 
        allowed me to form lifelong friendships, improve my focus and memorization, and understand the 
        correlation between religion and its impact on musical lyrics and language. While I'm not singing, 
        I also love to watch Indian movies (anything south Indian), explore new music, draw and paint, hang 
        out with friends and family, learn about new cultures, and try new foods. I'm also an avid sky enthusiast,
        with half my camera roll being pictures of sunsets and sunrises! In the future, I'm hoping to get more into 
        nature photography, and perhaps make a montage or photography account of some sort (to keep track of the evolution
        of my pictures and the perspective I view the world through). Thanks for reading this far, and I hope you were
        were able to learn a little bit about what I do for fun!
